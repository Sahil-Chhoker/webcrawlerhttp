# Simple Web Crawler

This is a basic web crawler written in javaScript that allows you to analyze a specific website and list the occurrences of each unique link found on the site. The crawler will print the link along with the number of times it appeared on the website.

## Notes

- This is a simple web crawler for educational purposes and may not cover all edge cases.
- Ensure you have proper permissions to crawl the target website.
- Be respectful of website terms of service and do not overload the server with too many requests.

Feel free to customize and enhance the web crawler according to your specific needs. Happy crawling!
